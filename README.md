# Particles
Particle System - The physics kind!

## About
This is a small little toy to simulate particles; currently, electromagnetism,
gravity, and collision are implemented. In the future, radioactivity and
possibly chromodynamics will be added as well. The forces are fairly accurate
to reality, but the constants are different, as are particle masses.

## Controls
* Left click and drag: Create particle with velocity
* Middle click: Create still particle
* Right click: Delete particle
* Escape: Clear the screen
* Space: Pause the simulation
* WASD: Pan the view
* Numbers 1-9: Load presets
* Backspace: Pick random color
* Plus/minus: Increase/decrease charge
* Brackets: Increase/decrease mass
* Backslash: Invert mass

## Particle Presets
Note: particle masses are not accurate to reality.
